			<h3 style="text-align: center;">Why 6x17? </h3><hr>
			<p>The 6x17 project really appeared out of nowhere for me.  I have always considered the panorama to be an aesthetically pleasing format for photography, however there are instances where it is used needlessly and can even hurt a composition.  This project is not about taking panoramics of everything I see.  It's about constraints.  Constraining yourself to look at the world from a different view portal.  In doing so, you also constrain yourself to the subjects that you can effectively convey through a photographic image.</p>
			<br>
			<p>When I'm out in the field, there is a  lot that I'm thinking about when searching for scenes to capture.  You have to consider the following elements: Light, Subject, Composition, and Context.  Needless to say, these elements are all interconnected in various ways.  How does the light accentuate the subject?  Does the light interact well iwth the composition?  Does the subject fit the composition or does the composition have to be altered?
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>All of these factors can clog the mind, and hinder creativity as you fumble through your work.  So I had to ask myself, "What if I could take one of these elements out of the equation?  What if I could simplify things a little bit more?"</p>
			<br>
			<p>The 6x17 project is an experiment in cognition.  By setting the aspect ratio at a constant 6x17, I hope to free the mind to explore and look for subjects that fit that frame.  This project is meant to document such an experiment.</p>
